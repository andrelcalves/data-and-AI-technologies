## Tag-centricity
InField is centered around tags, also known as assets, which means every work order or checklist task can be connected to its actual equipment counterpart in the field. This lets you access equipment data connected to a particular asset anytime by searching or clicking on a tag in a checklist. Watch how to look up your data below.

## Checklists

The Checklists page is where you find and work on checklists and is accessible on desktop and handheld devices.

progress, tasks with status, each task neeed to be completed. You can upload video and images. You can update a set of task instaed of go one by one.


## Templates

Templates are available in the desktop view. From it, you can create and edit lists of tasks that become checklists for fieldwork. A template can have any number of tasks, and you can create as many checklists as you want from the same template. Connecting your to-do list to the relevant industrial data gives users immediate access to the necessary information. It also makes it so all new information is saved.

When the templates are created it will be in restricted status to not be changed.

## Overview

On the Overview tab, you'll see all planned activities divided into maintenance work and operator rounds. It provides access to a backlog of planned activities, offering details like descriptions, timings, and locations, and facilitates the creation of task checklists, enabling assignment to specific users or disciplines and allowing for progress monitoring.
