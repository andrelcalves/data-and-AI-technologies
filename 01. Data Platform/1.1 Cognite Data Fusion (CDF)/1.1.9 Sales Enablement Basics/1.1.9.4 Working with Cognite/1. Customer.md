Selling Adoption

When selling a project to deliver a use case, maybe as part of a larger deal that includes ARR, you need to consider what will happen after the project ends. Consider these questions:

Does the customer want to be self-sufficient with CDF?

Do they want to know how to build and maintain use cases themselves?

Are we co-selling and co-delivering with a partner? 

Does the customer just want to use the solution Cognite has built for them?

The knowledge youâ€™ll gain in this course will guide you in these discussions.
